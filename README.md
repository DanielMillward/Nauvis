TODO list:
- borders between tiles (main.ts:119)
    - refactor the code so direction-specific information is encoded in a data struct we reuse
    - ^^ Maybe make a function that gets a tile neighbor given a chunk/tile coord and direction?
- only render chunks in view
- make tiles updateable
- fix weird blank spots that show when zooming sometimes
- entities
    - animated
- UI
- Input handling
- minimap
